This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Deploy in Vercel:
  - https://react-next-js-instagram-clone.vercel.app/
  
Tech:
  - Nextjs
  - tailwind css
  - firebase v9 (firebase firestore, firebase storage)
  - custom Next OAuth
  - Recoil (state&&global management) == redux
  - faker.js = generate fake data
  
Features:
  - Google Authentication using NextAuth
  - Users can Post photos with caption
  - Users can like and comment on any post
  - Users can message other users of this app
  - Users can send Picture as a message
  - Fully Responsive
  - Log out feature
  - Without logging in, you can see only see posts and stories


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
